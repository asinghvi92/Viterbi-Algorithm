# Viterbi-Algorithm
Part of speech (POS) tagging using Viterbi Algorithm

- Worked on Natural Language processing of part of speech (POS) tagging 
- Implemented bigram Viterbi Algorithm using a training file consisting of several transition and emission probabilities 

To compile and run 
python my_viterbi.py probs.txt sents.txt

Dataset Description 
- Currently a simple training file of few transition and emission probabilities is used
- For values outside the training set, a default 0.0001 is used
- Algorithm is tested on sample test file consisting of few sentences 
- This can be scaled by adding more values to the training file
